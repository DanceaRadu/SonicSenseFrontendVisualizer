## Overview

This is an Angular 19 application that serves as the frontend for the Sonic Sense project. It provides a user interface that interacts with the backend, allowing users to visualize and manage sound events. The app can also be used to view the live feed from the camera using WebRTC.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever any of the source files are modified.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile the project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.

## Hosting

The website is hosted on a personal server. This app should (hopefully) still be accessible at [https://sonic-sense.gonemesis.org/](https://sonic-sense.gonemesis.org/).
